Schedule working timetable for a nurse in N consecutive days 1, 2,..., N.
This is divided into series of consecutive working days (working period)

Constraints:
+ only 1 day off between 2 working period
+ A working period has length in segment [K1, K2]
Input: N, K1, K2
Output: number of valid ways to Schedule
Ex:
stdin: 6 2 3
output: 4


Solution:
Dynamic Programming

P[i]: number of valid ways to schedule if day i_th: working
Q[i]: number of valid ways to schedule if day i_th: off

=> P[i] = sum_{{j=K1} ^K2}(Q[i-j]) // off: i-j, work : i-j+1, i-j+2, ..., i-1, i 
=> Q[i] = P[i-1]
